# ProjectDarkErebus

Welcome to ProjectDarkErebus!

#### Why DarkErebus?
- It's a codename I picked for my project until I can come up with a better name. Erebus is the Greek God of Darkness.

#### What is this?
- ProjectDarkErebus is my attempt to create a bot to predict NFL games.

#### How are the predictions made?
- I am currently pulling statistics from various sources and running them through multiple machine learning algorithms.
- So far, I have successfully implemented Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, Random Forrest,XGBoost, and K Nearest Neighbor.
- I am working to add Neural Networks and Naive Bayes.
